## About The App

Bus Stop Info App is a very small and simple application for finding information about bus stops.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it leverages [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) to connect with the [digitransit routing API for the Helsinki region](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/1-routing-api/). The (extremely simplified) styling is handled using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components.

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Navigate to the repository
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` (the undersigned prefers `yarn`)
- Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You may also deploy the application on your own, either using the project's own [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) configuration to deploy it to [Heroku](https://heroku.com), or define your own deployment pipeline.
